#### Research Interest

My interest includes 
- Modeling of 5G and beyond 5G networks using Stochastic geometery
- Heterogeneous Cellular networks for 5G, 
- Energy efficiency and resource allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular networks, 
- Full duplex MIMO and massive MIMO. 
- Millimeter wave communications
- D2D communication
- UAV assisted communication
- Machine learning in communication
- I am also interested in performance-complexity analysis of detection algorithms and channel coding for MIMO-OFDM system.
