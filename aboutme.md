I am a PhD student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](https://www.giki.edu.pk/) Pakistan. My research is supervised by  [Dr. Zia ulhaq Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas). My PhD thesis broadly focuses on modeling and Energy Efficiency based analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes.

Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure on reading about photography and experimenting with my camera.
