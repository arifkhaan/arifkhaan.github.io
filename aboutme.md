#### Briefly
I am a PhD student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](http://giki.edu.pk) Pakistan. My research is supervised by  [Dr. Zia ulhaq Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas). My PhD thesis broadly focuses on modeling and Energy Efficiency based analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes. Prior to joining [TeleCoN Lab](https://www.giki.edu.pk/telecon) at GIKI, I worked as operation and maintaenance Engineering and also served as lecturer and visiting lecturer post.


Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure on reading about photography and experimenting with my camera.


#### Research Interest

My interest includes 
- Modeling of 5G and beyond 5G networks using Stochastic geometery
- Heterogeneous Cellular networks for 5G, 
- Energy efficiency and resource allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular networks, 
- Full duplex MIMO and massive MIMO. 
- Millimeter wave communications
- D2D communication
- UAV assisted communication
- Machine learning in communication
- I am also interested in performance-complexity analysis of detection algorithms and channel coding for MIMO-OFDM system.
