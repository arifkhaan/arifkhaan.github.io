I am a PhD student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](https://www.giki.edu.pk/) Pakistan. My research is supervised by  [Dr. Zia ulhaq Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas). My PhD thesis broadly focuses on modeling and Energy Efficiency based analysis of heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes. Prior to joining [TeleCoN Lab](https://www.giki.edu.pk/telecon) at GIKI, I worked as operation and maintaenance Engineering and also served as lecturer and visiting lecturer post.


Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure on reading about photography and experimenting with my camera.
