I am graduated with master of science (MS) degree in Electrical Engineeriing from COMSATS University and P.hD. degree in Electronics and Commuication Engineering from [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](https://www.giki.edu.pk/) Pakistan, in 2016 and 2021, respectively. During my MS research, I worked on the performance analysis of detection algorithms for MIMO-OFDM receivers in the supervision of [Prof. Dr Shahid Khattak](https://www.giki.edu). I carried out my PhD research in the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ziaul Haq Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas) and [Prof. Dr. Ghulam Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/). My PhD thesis broadly focuses on performance analysis of user-centric small cell aided heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes. Prior to joining [TeleCoN Lab](https://www.giki.edu.pk/telecon) at GIKI, I worked as operation and maintaenance engineer and also served as visiting lecturer at COMWAVE Institute (Part time).

After completing my PhD, I worked as a Post-Doc fellow at [Smart Networing Laboratory (SNL)](https://www.giki.edu), Chosun University from Nov. 2021 to Mar. 2022. My Post-Doc work was mainly focusing on the 1) modelling and performance analysis of the flying adhoc/aerial-terrestrail networks and 2) the use of machine learning techniques in wireless networks. 

Then I joined the [Department of Computer Engineering at Chosun University](https://www.chosun.ac.kr) in Apr. 2022 as an Assistant Professor. My current research mainly span in the area of intelligent 5G and beyond networks.


Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure time in reading, exploring nature, and outing with my nearest friends.
