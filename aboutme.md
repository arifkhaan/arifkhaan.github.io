### Hi, I'm Arif!! ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src="../img/arifnnew.jpg" height="250px">

I am graduated with master of science (MS) degree in Electrical Engineeriing from COMSATS University and P.hD. degree in Electronics and Commuication Engineering from [Ghulam Ishaq Khan (GIK) Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology Topi, Swabi](https://www.giki.edu.pk/) Pakistan, in 2016 and 2021, respectively. During my MS research, I worked on the performance analysis of detection algorithms for MIMO-OFDM receivers in the supervision of Prof. Dr Shahid Khattak. I carried out my PhD research in the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ziaul Haq Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas) and [Prof. Dr. Ghulam Abbas](https://www.giki.edu.pk/Faculty/Dr-Zia-ul-Haq-Abbas). My PhD thesis broadly focuses on performance analysis of user-centric small cell aided heterogeneous cellular networks using the tools of stochastic geometry and the theory of point processes. Prior to joining [TeleCoN Lab](https://www.giki.edu.pk/telecon) at GIKI, I worked as operation and maintaenance engineer and also served as visiting lecturer at COMWAVE Institute (Part time).

After completing my PhD, I worked as a Post-Doc fellow at the Smart Networing Laboratory (SNL) at Chosun University from Nov. 2021 to Mar. 2022. My Post-Doc work was mainly focusing on the 1) modelling and performance analysis of the flying adhoc/aerial-terrestrail networks and 2) the use of machine learning techniques in wireless networks. 

Then I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at Chosun University in Apr. 2022 as an Assistant Professor. My current research mainly span in the area of intelligent 5G and beyond networks.


Keeping aside all the jargons, maths and information, I love to spend my leisure time in reading, exploring nature, and outing with my nearest friends.
